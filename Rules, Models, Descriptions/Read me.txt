The folder named "Models" contains:
 
 1. The description of the base model that can be used for its calibration. 
    The XML file named "qualitymodel_description.xml" can be loaded into 
    QualityModelDesigner.jar for the base model's recalibration, or as a starting 
    point for the derivation of a new quality model through tailoring.

 2. The base model itself (as it derived from the calibration process) in XML format.
    It can be used for the quality assessment of a desired Java product via the
    offline quality evaluation tools (i.e. SingleProjectEvaluator.jar and 
    WorkspaceEvaluator.jar) or the online evaluator of open source projects 
    (i.e. onlineEvaluationScript.jar).

ATTENTION:

 - You should make sure that the desired rulesets described in the aforementioned 
   XML files are placed in the applications' working directory and especially in
   a folder named "Rulesets".

The folder named "Rulesets" contains the predefined custom PMD rulesets that we
used for the derivation of the base model. You can copy this folder and paste it
into the applications' working directory so that they will be reckognized by the
qualityModel.xml and qualityModel_description.xml (as mentioned above).
